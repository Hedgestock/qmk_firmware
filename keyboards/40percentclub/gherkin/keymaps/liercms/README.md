# LIER (CMS)

This layout is theoretically optimized for French, based on frequency analysis of the letters, digrams and trigrams of the french language.
It uses the canadian multilingual standard layout since it is the layout supporting the most accentuated characters by default.

## Base layer

Each key on the home row is supposed to be part of the most frequent letter, then comes the upper row and lastly the lower row.
Most used keys in a row are assigned to the middle finger (since it is only responsible for 3 keys and is supposedly relatively strong), then to the index (which should be the strongest but also in charge of 6 keys), the ring finger and finally the pinky (weakest of them all).
Characters often used in the same digrams or trigrams are placed in opposite sides whenever possible to make them easier to type fast.
Space and Enter can be used by the thumbs (I mostly use my right thumb for both) relieving a bit the indexes from their work.
Dot and comma are in the middle of the keyboard, pressing them simultaneously should result in a semicolon, and shifting them respectively gives exclamation mark and question mark.

## Accents layer

This layer gives access to the most used (in French) accentuated version of the character, with other variants on the nearby keys.
It also gives access to orthographic ligatures by comboing the keys that hold the character forming the ligature on the base layer.
Some of the remaining keys are used for dead accent keys in case the default accentuated letters are not enough.
In addition, this layers holds some special characters that did not fit any other layer.

## Numbers and Symbols layer

Pretty straightforward, here is located every useful symbol (at least for most programmers), french and curly quotes, and a numeric pad.
This is also the only layer not having an Enter key, nor a Space/Backspace one but they are rarely used on layers anyway apart maybe the accents one.

## Functions layer

Here lie all the function keys, plus the secondary keys one could want in a keyboard, such as the arrows and the media keys.
Once again, nothing too fancy.
